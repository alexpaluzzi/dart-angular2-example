# dart-angular2-example

This repo is a (manual) mirror of the latest Dart example code from Angular 2 (alpha).

The master will be updated often to match the latest from the [angular2 repo](https://github.com/angular/angular).

Use this if you want to skip JS/Gulp build steps to get up and running quickly.

Angular2 is in alpha and is GUARANTEED to go through substantial changes as it stabilizes. Please expect this.

## Get Started

1. `pub get`
2. `pub serve`

Navigate to localhost:8080 in Dartium (for DartVM) or other browser (for dart2js).
